            <h3>Income Classification using ML</h3>
            <p>
              This project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms to predict income levels based on demographic 
              and socio-economic data. We implemented and compared models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest,
              Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks using datasets like the UCI Adult Income Dataset and Gallup World Poll.
              The goal was to identify the most accurate and reliable methods for classifying income levels, with applications in social 
              research, economic policy, and financial analysis.

            <h3>Document Manager System</h3>
            <p>
              The Document Management System is a secure, full-stack web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, 
              and MySQL. It allows users to upload, organize, and manage digital documents efficiently with features like user 
              authentication using JWT, document version control, smart search, and role-based access control. The system also includes 
              a commenting feature for collaboration and uses encryption to ensure the privacy and security of stored files. This project
               highlights my ability to build robust, user-friendly web applications with real-world functionality and a focus on data security.
